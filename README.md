The Classical Liberals sought to remove all forms of privilege. Governments are for establishing and maintaining order. States are established for conferring privilege. If you doubt the third point then consider all the powers which men have written into state and national constitutions. From where does the power to set and grow government come? As time progresses does power remain with families and communities or does it migrate into the state enabled legal fictions which are corporations and states?

Who set the work em till they’re dead order? How is a system of 40 hour work weeks maintained, with a normative virtue to work more without thinking of the consequences, when the economist from four score years correctly predicted that by now we’d only need to work 4 for the same standard of living?
