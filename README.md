### People can play games of dominance; those doing so usually already know how to win.
Plays for control and possession result in inefficiency, injury, and premature death. Instead, we can focus on the quality of everyone's life equally by looking into securing the components necessary so that each is able to live a whole life in a thriving way.

### If we’re not defining the future someone else is.
The Classical Liberals sought to remove all forms of privilege. Governments are for establishing and maintaining order. States are about conferring privilege. If you doubt the third point then consider all the advantages which authors have written into state and federal laws. From where does the power to set and grow government come? As time progresses does the locus of control remain with individuals, families, and communities or does it migrate into the state enabled legal fictions which are corporations and states?

### Who maintains the work 'em 'til they’re dead order? 
How is a system of 40 hour work weeks maintained, with a normative virtue to work more without thinking of the consequences, after [the economist](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/26/no-time#:~:text=It%20was%20titled%20%E2%80%9CEconomic%20Possibilities,to%20worry%20about%20making%20money.) generations ago pointed out that by now we’d only need to work 15 for the same standard of living?

### Selecting the appropriate construct
There exists a materialist reductivist construct which history proves is useful for the purpose of dividing the groups held subject to it. Disregarding the construct allows one to see the means to living as **natural resources**, **labor**, and **durable capital goods**. Through work and purchase decisions our way is determined.

### Compliance to too many working hours overspends the Earth. 
The compliance of what would otherwise be free human beings—turned into laborers, enabled through taxation and standing military is the taking of natural resources from other nations contributing to an [annual over-expendature of the Earth](https://www.overshootday.org/about-earth-overshoot-day/). The functional process results in the handling of laborers, both in the conquering and the conquered nations, merely as though they were part of the means which is natural resources only.

### Priorities

>Things were created to be used.

Government needs to remove its practice of drawing revenue from labor and durable goods because the act cuts into the expression, production, and trade of each. In order not to incur a [dead-weight loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mEn9zxQ0Q0) in the economy all government shall have to instead seek its funds from appropriately assessed natural resource extraction fees, [pigovian](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pigoviantax.asp#:~:text=A%20Pigovian%20(Pigouvian)%20tax%20is,of%20the%20product's%20market%20price.), and location-value taxation. [FICA](https://personal-finance.extension.org/what-is-fica-tax-and-how-is-it-calculated/) (minus income) tax can stay but sales, capital gains, property, and income tax except for that portion of rental income which comes from location-value, and tariffs need to be abolished.

### Keys to success
What people do to make income and how they spend it is not the business of government by the people; how natural resources are distributed is government's business. We must recognize natural resources as our shared inheritance: by mutual right—we're each entitled to an equal share. The full value of natural resources made private through extraction fee, resource lease agreement, and any polution cleanup charges have to be collected. Taxpayers need to be able to track where their tax dollars go in order so that the same are enabled to determine the appropriate size of government. So that people may be free, trade must be free. Revenue therefore must come via charges on non-human resource use.

### Benefits
By taking this direction people will stop being treated as resources by their governments. Natural resources will be more efficiently spent.

### Conclusion
Focus needs to be on the actual means; and the means must not be divided into the oppositional reductionist form so that greater focus may rest upon the source of all and the work of the love of all.
