Present situation and its disentaglements

# If we’re not defining the future someone else is.
The Classical Liberals sought to remove all forms of privilege. Governments are for establishing and maintaining order. States are about conferring privilege. If you doubt the third point then consider all the advantages which authors have written into state and federal laws. From where does the power to set and grow government come? As time progresses does the locus of control remain with individuals, families, and communities or does it migrate into the state enabled legal fictions which are corporations and states?

# Who maintains the work 'em 'til they’re dead order? 
How is a system of 40 hour work weeks maintained, with a normative virtue to work more without thinking of the consequences, after the economist from four score years prior correctly pointed out that by now we’d only need to work 4 for the same standard of living?

# Means of Production
There exists a materialist reductivist construct, which experience proves useful for the purpose of dividing the groups held subject to it. Side-stepping oneself from said construct allows one to see the means of production as defined by the Classical Liberals who recognized the three components as natural resources, labour, and durable capital goods.

# Compliance to too many working hours overspends the Earth. 
The compliance of what would otherwise be individual enterprisers—turned into workers, enabled through taxation and standing military is the taking of natural resources from other nations. And the overall process treats labor itself, both in the conquering and the conquered nation, as part of what rightfully is natural resources only.

# The End
Focus needs to be on the actual means; and the means must not be divided into the oppositional reductionist form so that greater focus may exist on the source of all and the love of all.
